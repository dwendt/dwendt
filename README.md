Hi! My repositories on GitHub are generally related to:


🐞 bughunting

🪓 random patches to software I use

🙈 a few old gamehacking repos

Nothing too interesting or representative of what I do professionally :) 

Hopefully I've written something interesting on my [blog](http://a-zA-Z0-9.net) and that's how you got here!

Everything on this Github account is intended to be ***personal*** and ***separate*** from my dayjob, worked on at home on personal hardware, and avoiding any conflict of interest. If I write that in advance it means the lawyers can't bother me, right?
